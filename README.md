Game Programming - Shaders
==========================

This repository contains the shaders shown in the lecture Shaders taught at [Hamburg University of Applied Sciences](http://www.haw-hamburg.de/english.html).

Unity build-in shaders can be downloaded from the official [Unity Download Archive](http://unity3d.com/unity/download/archive).
